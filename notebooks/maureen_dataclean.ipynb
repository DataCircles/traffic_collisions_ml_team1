    "\n",
    "<b>Approach/model 1: </b><br>\n",
    "Look at the number of collisions at each intersection and quantify how much each feature of the intersection (eg, pavement, crosswalk, etc) contributes to having a high number of collisions.\n",
    "Implementation: Pandas group by intersection to get number of collisions, then fit regression model on the features in the df that corresponds to characteristics of that intersection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential issues: no marker for number of people using intersection, which might be an important characteristic to note. Danger can then be defined as #collisions/#people using intersection. Some intersections with high traffic might have lower collisions rates than others.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Approach/model 2:</b><br>\n",
    "Look at other features that are highly correlated with collisions. These can be independent of the intersection (weather, ligh levels, etc). While some of these cannot be improved upon by the city, others can be (eg, low light levels mitigated by street lights). There should be some grouping by intersections to see if some intersections have a disproportionate amount of collisions due to these effects. \n",

    "### Cleaning\n",
    "The first part of data cleaning is to accurately measure the number of ped-car and cyclist-car collisions. Approximately 9% of the data doesn't have a ped, car, OR cyclist count, which inhibits our ability to accurately categorize accidents. "
